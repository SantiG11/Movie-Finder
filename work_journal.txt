29/09/24_ I started with the developing branch of the project. First, based on the figma model I designed, I created a flow diagram in excalidraw to have a vision on the structure of the projec.
Then, I started the project structure  in the App.jsx file where I added the Header, the Hero and the SortBar components. 

The Header component returns a header element with an H1 with the name of the page.
The Hero component returns a div with the SearchBar component.
The SortBar component returns a div with an h3 that will explain the criteria to display the movies, wich initially will be trending movies. And two Button components, one to filter by genre, and another to sort them by different criterias.

Now I'm working with the Button components logic. They should display a dropdown when clicked with a ul list showing buttons to select any item. For this purpose I need to have clear how to do this. 

30/09/24 I been working on the dropdown components style and structure.

01/10/24 Commited previous changes to the developing branch.
Today I worked on getting the movies from the API with fetch. The way I found to make it work was putting the fetch function in the MoviesGrid component body. And added a state and a section to change the pages.
The next steps are going to fetch the movies through the search bar, and make the filtering and the sorting buttons work. 


03/10/24 Today I worked with the search bar component, and now it fetches the movies taking the value of the search bar and a grid with the results is rendered when I submit the search replacing the MoviesGrid component. 

05/10/24 I worked with the dropdown component and it's functionality. First, I worked in the structure, making it return two components: a label, and a selection. The label is displaying the text content of the dropdown and the selection the options to select.

After that, I started figuring out how to filter the results by genre. First I fetch the genres list wich returns an array of objects with the name and the id of each genre. Then I worked in a function to find the id with the name of the genre, and the next step is going to be pass the genre from the selection of the dropdown componenet to the find function, and from the id obtained I got to figure it out how to fetch the movies again with the genre filter.

07/10 I'm starting to know how useContext work and testing it, until i'm able to set differents global states for genre, genres, and page (there could be more), to read them and change them along the whole page.

09/10 Today I started using the useContext hook, creating the MoviesContext to store the states of pages and genres to update them with each part where needed.

Now the MoviesContext has the states of page, pageLength, genreId, searching and searchInput with a set method for each. And at this point none of the components are receiving props.

I added the page variable to the FetchSearch function to change pages with the results. And created the PageBar component to change between pages.

The sort bar it's now rendered when searching is false, this is because the api doesn't allow to filter or sort the results of the search.

Now the droprown to filter by genre is working.

I'm getting an alert message when I render the SearchResults component saying this: "Cannot update a component (`MoviesProvider`) while rendering a different component (`SearchResults`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `SearchResults`"
